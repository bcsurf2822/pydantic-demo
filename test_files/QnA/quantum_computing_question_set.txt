Complex Questions Requiring Deep Analysis:

  1. What specific time window showed the highest success rate for quantum teleportation protocols, and which team member made this observation?
    - Answer requires finding: Dr. Sarah Kim noted 41% improvement between 2:00 AM and 5:00 AM
  2. What is the exact percentage improvement in drug interaction model precision achieved through the Biogen collaboration, and how does this compare to the overall quantum gate 
  fidelity improvement?
    - Answer requires finding: 67% vs 34.7% and understanding these are different metrics
  3. What is the projected cost reduction percentage for the proposed silicon photonic integration, and who is leading this engineering effort?
    - Answer requires finding: Dr. Marcus Thompson proposing 78% cost reduction
  4. What correlation did the research reveal that led to the development of compensation algorithms, and what temperature threshold is required for the experimental setup?
    - Answer requires finding: Electromagnetic field fluctuations correlation and below 10 millikelvin
  5. What is the total funding amount mentioned for commercialization efforts, which firm is providing it, and what is the target timeline for QCaaS deployment?
    - Answer requires finding: Andreessen Horowitz, $150 million, Q3 2025
