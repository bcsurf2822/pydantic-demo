## Progress Tracking Notes

**Organization Strategy:** Tasks are grouped by functional areas rather than sequential steps. As development progresses, mark tasks complete within each section and move between sections as needed based on dependencies and priorities.

**Key Dependencies:**
1. Project setup must be completed before other tasks
2. Authentication system needed before chat and document features
3. Database verification required before implementing data operations
4. UI design system should be established early for consistent development

**Database Integration Points:**
- All user interactions should respect RLS policies
- Session management must follow `{user_id}~{timestamp}` pattern
- JSONB fields require proper TypeScript typing
- Vector operations need special handling for embeddings
